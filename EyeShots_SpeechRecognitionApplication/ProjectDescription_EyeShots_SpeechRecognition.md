# **EyeShots: Voice-Controlled Android Application**

## **Project Overview**

**EyeShots** is a voice-controlled Android application designed to enhance the accessibility of devices for visually impaired users. By offering voice-driven control, it eliminates the need for traditional touch-based interactions, allowing users to perform tasks such as checking the time, date, battery status, making phone calls, and opening other applications through speech recognition. This hands-free operation improves user convenience and safety, especially when multitasking or driving.

## **Technologies Used**
- **Programming Language**: Java
- **Development Environment**: Android Studio

## **Version Breakdown**

### **Version 1 - Core Features**
- **Time & Date Access**: Retrieve the current system date using the voice command "Today's Date" and system time with "Time".
- **Battery Status**: Check the system's battery level with the "Battery" command. A warning is provided if the battery falls below 20%.
- **Phone Calls**: Make phone calls by speaking the recipient’s number, facilitated by speech recognition.
- **Unread Messages**: Have unread text messages read aloud to the user.
- **App Exit**: Exit the app using the "Exit From the App" command, with an option to close the floating window via a cross button.

### **Version 2 - Enhanced Functionality**
- **App Launching**: Open other applications such as Gmail, Facebook, Camera, and Chrome via voice commands.
- **Navigation Drawer**: A streamlined interface for easy access and management of the app's features.
- **Dual Operating Modes**:
  - **Normal Mode**: Access all features within the app’s standard interface.
  - **Speaker Mode**: Offers a floating window to control the app from any screen on the device, optimized for visually impaired users.
- **Share & Rate**: The app includes options for users to share the app with others and rate the app for feedback and future improvements.

## **Advantages**
- **Inclusive Design**: EyeShots allows visually impaired individuals to navigate their devices using voice commands, providing greater independence.
- **Dual Operation Modes**: Offers flexibility between a standard interface and a floating control window, enhancing accessibility.
- **Hands-Free Operation**: Ideal for scenarios where touch-based interactions are impractical, such as while driving or multitasking.

## **Future Development**
Future iterations of EyeShots will focus on expanding its functionality, improving user experience, and addressing current limitations. Potential enhancements include:
- Integration with more third-party applications.
- Improvements to voice recognition accuracy, especially in noisy environments.
- Development of additional features to cater to a broader range of accessibility needs.
- Ongoing efforts to refine the app's security and privacy protocols to safeguard sensitive user data.

## **Conclusion**
EyeShots empowers visually impaired users to independently control their Android devices via voice commands, significantly improving accessibility and user convenience. The app’s dual-mode operation and simple, intuitive design make it an invaluable tool for users seeking hands-free device interaction.
